# What's going on? 

First off, welcome to OHI/O! This is a bunch of programmers in one place. That's fun, right? Exactly. Basically, you have 36 hours to make some really cool shit. Here, we start from an idea or nothing. No previous code. Get ready, because it's going to be awesome. 

# Rules

- Don't be a jerk
- You cannot use code you or a teammate has previously written.
- APIs, Libraries, and Frameworks are all okay.
- Commit to your private repository every 4 hours.
- *Start* coding at Oct 3, 8:30PM.
- *Stop* coding at Oct 5, 8:00AM.
- Really, don't be a jerk.
- Questions can be asked in person at the help desk or tweeted at *@hackohio*


# Using GitHub

## Helpful Links

## Our Recommended Process 

1. We will create your team when you check in. You will have the power to create repositories. 
2. Go to the [Ohio Hackathon Page](https://github.com/OHIOhackathon2014) and create a repo for your project. We recommend making it private, that way other teams cannot see your code. If you do not see a "+ New Repository" button, contact the code auditor.

3. Give your repository a name. Please use the format t##\<shortname\>. An example would be "t03OSUFoLyf".

    ![name repo](https://github.com/OHIOhackathon2014/SampleProject/blob/master/img/name-repo.png)

4. If you click the "Initialize this repository with a README" button, then it will make the Readme for you!
5. You should add the licensing information as well. If you know how to do a .gitignore, then add it, otherwise won't bother with it. 
6. Go ahead and create the repository now. You'll see a page like this.
    
    ![the repo](https://github.com/OHIOhackathon2014/SampleProject/blob/master/img/the-repo.png)

7. The page will explain what to do next. You need to create the project locally on your computer too. 
8. Next is simply a combination of `add`, `commit`, and `push` . The GitHub GUI ([windows](https://windows.github.com/), [mac](https://windows.github.com/)) is best for beginners.
