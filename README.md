# Using GitHub

## Our Recommended Process 

1. We will create your team when you check in. You will have the power to create repositories. 
2. Go to the [Ohio Hackathon Page](https://github.com/OHIOhackathon2014) and create a repo for your project. We recommend making it private, that way other teams cannot see your code. If you do not see a "+ New Repository" button, contact the code auditor.

3. Give your repository a name. Please use the format t##\<shortname\>. An example would be "t03OSUFoLyf".

4. If you click the "Initialize this repository with a README" button, then it will make the Readme for you!
5. You should add the licensing information as well. If you know how to do a .gitignore, then add it, otherwise won't bother with it. 
6. Go ahead and create the repository now. You'll see a page like this.
    
    ![the repo](https://github.com/OHIOhackathon2014/SampleProject/blob/master/img/the-repo.png)

7. The page will explain what to do next. You need to create the project locally on your computer too. 
8. Next is simply a combination of `add`, `commit`, and `push` . The GitHub GUI ([windows](https://windows.github.com/), [mac](https://windows.github.com/)) is best for beginners.
